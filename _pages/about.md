Hey there I am George (Giorgos or Georgios in Greek)! 

I'm all about diving deep into the world of data and software engineering. It's not just a career for me; it's a passion. Think of me as a tech enthusiast with a green heart, always on the lookout for ways to mesh cutting-edge tech with sustainable solutions.

My journey started with environmental engineering, but a curious mind and a drive for innovation led me to the fascinating realms of Data Analytics, AI, and everything tech. After wrapping up my master's in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at DTU, I knew I was on the right path.

I get a kick out of tackling those tough, twisty problems with smart, data-driven approaches. And why not have a bit of fun along the way, right? My goal? To be the go-to person who helps businesses not just succeed but do so sustainably and innovatively. 

Let's make the digital world a bit greener, one data solution at a time!
